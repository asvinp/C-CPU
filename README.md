# C-CPU

## [CMPE 200] - CPU (x86) Simulation

- [x] Designed a virtual CPU to load and store data using simulated registers and memory using C programming
- [x] Developed functionality for an ALU along with conditional codes, jumps and function calls

The project was aimed at simulating a CPU to understand CPU architecture. MIPS and Intel x86 were
the two architectures studied as part of initial research. Intel x86 architecture was used as a
reference while implementing the CPU. The primary goal of the CPU design was to implement
functions to fetch and store data as per user input. 

The team successfully simulated a CPU using ‘C’ programming in order to load and
store data to simulated registers and memory. The team also added ALU functionality along with conditional codes, jumps and function calls.
